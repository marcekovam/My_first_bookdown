My first bookdown template is based on [GitBook template](https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template) by [Joyce Robbins](https://github.com/jtr13). Changes in appearance are inspired by [rstudio4edu](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/index.html). Color chart used in this bookdown can be seen at [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/material-design-color-chart/).

### Some useful `R` commands

- `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`

- `browseURL("docs/index.html")`

### Please,
